## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together prose and
executable code into one document.
Just look at @fig-penguins!

```{r}
#| label: fig-penguins
#| fig-cap: A plot about penguins.
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(
  data = palmerpenguins::penguins |> na.omit(),
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)
) + geom_point()
```
